Hacking with Swift Project 10 - with solution to the challenges
This project is based on Paul Hudson (Twitter @twostraws) Hacking with Swift Project 10. It contains my solutions to his challenges during Day 42 of the 100 Days of Swift initiative (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/42).


Challenges



1) Add a second UIAlertController that gets shown when the user taps a picture, asking them whether they want to rename the person or delete them.
2) Try using picker.sourceType = .camera when creating your image picker, which will tell it to create a new image by taking a photo. This is only available on devices (not on the simulator) so you might want to check the return value of UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable() before trying to use it!
3) Modify project 1 so that it uses a collection view controller rather than a table view controller. I recommend you keep a copy of your original table view controller code so you can refer back to it later on.
